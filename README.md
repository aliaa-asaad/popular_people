# popular_people

## App features:
- get popular data in the first screen with local data storage and pagination
- when user chooses a person,he/she moves to a new screen with the basic info of the person and a gridview of his/her images
- when user selects an image, he/she moves to a new screen with the image im its original size and can download it on the phone

## App was build with:
- state management: cubit
- network: dio, shared preferences
- arch: MVVM and clean arch
- testing: unit test

## App Problems:
- the pagination ui should be handled with the gridview
- there is a dublication in the data while getting the new data ( i don't know the reason as the logs refer to it works as logic)
- can't store the images in the local database
- there is error 404 when i try to get images data from configration api and don't know the reason
